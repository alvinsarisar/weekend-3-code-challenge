**#Flatiron Movie Theatre**
**##Description**
Flatiron Movie Theatre is a web application that allows users to browse through a list of movies, view detailed information about each movie, and buy tickets.

**##Features**
View a list of available movies.
Display detailed information about a selected movie, including the poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets.
Buy tickets for a selected movie, with real-time updates on ticket availability.
Background
This project is a part of the Flatiron School curriculum aimed at teaching students how to build interactive web applications using front-end technologies.

Alternatives
